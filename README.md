# SVM
Support Vector Machines
I had to realise svm and make a graph of the dependence of the program running time on the number of tests, the dimension of the space, and the number of points
n_samples = 100
n_features = 100
n_tests = 100 
Here you can easily change to any value
The first is the number of points
Second, dimensions
Third is the number of tests
